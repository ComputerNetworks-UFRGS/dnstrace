# Contributing

- All contributions should be made branching from `development`.

## On a new feature implementation

1. /Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b features/implementationName`
2. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
3. Push to remote: `git push origin features/implementationName`
4. Create a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/ComputerNetworks-UFRGS/dnstracker/pulls) with your branch name, using the base branch `development`.
  - If you are not finished with your implementation, prepend [WIP] to your PR name.
  - Assign reviewers to your PR and assign it to self.
  - Describe your implementation for the reviewer.
5. Wait for reviews. If no changes are needed, including file conflicts, you can safely merge your pull request to the base branch.

**After your pull request is merged**, you can safely delete your branch.
